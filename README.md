## Hi there 👋

<!--# 👋 Hi, I am Duncan Kibet

Software Engineer with a strong foundation in backend and full-stack development, 
currently specializing in **smart contract security and auditing**.

I recently completed a **Software Engineering bootcamp**, and I am now focused on 
building deep expertise in **Solidity, EVM behavior, and DeFi security**.

---

## 🔐 Smart Contract Security Focus
I am actively training and documenting my journey toward becoming a professional
smart contract auditor.

Current areas of focus:
- Access control & ownership vulnerabilities
- Constructor & deployment bugs
- tx.origin misuse
- Predictable on-chain randomness
- Fallback / receive function exploits
- Reentrancy & external call risks

Training platforms:
- Ethernaut (hands-on exploitation)
- Cyfrin Updraft (auditor-grade theory)
- Foundry & Remix (PoCs and testing)

---

## 🧪 Featured Security Work
- 🧠 **Ethernaut Writeups** — practical exploit breakdowns  
- 🧨 **Proof-of-Concept Attacks** — minimal, reproducible exploits  
- 📄 **Audit-Style Notes** — root cause, impact, and prevention  

👉 See pinned repositories below.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
**Languages:**  
- Solidity, JavaScript, Python

**Frameworks & Tools:**  
- Foundry, Hardhat, Remix  
- Flask, React  
- Git, GitHub  
- PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy  

**Concepts:**  
- Smart contract security  
- DeFi protocol mechanics  
- Backend API design  
- Authentication & authorization
